BTF is a software package for permuting a matrix into block upper triangular
form.  It includes a maximum transversal algorithm, which finds a permutation
of a square or rectangular matrix so that it has a zero-free diagonal (if one
exists); otherwise, it finds a maximal matching which maximizes the number of
nonzeros on the diagonal.  The package also includes a method for finding the
strongly connected components of a graph.  These two methods together give the
permutation to block upper triangular form.

Requires SuiteSparse_config, in the ../SuiteSparse_config directory relative to
this directory.  KLU relies on the BTF package to permute the matrix prior to
factorization.

To compile the libbtf.a library, type "make".  The compiled library is located
in BTF/Lib/libbtf.a.  Compile code that uses BTF with -IBTF/Include.

Type "make clean" to remove all but the compiled library, and "make distclean"
to remove all files not in the original distribution.

This package does not include a statement coverage test (Tcov directory) or
demo program (Demo directory).  See the KLU package for both.  The BTF package
does include a MATLAB interface, a MATLAB test suite (in the MATLAB/Test
directory), and a MATLAB demo.

See BTF/Include/btf.h for documentation on how to use the C-callable functions.
Use "help btf", "help maxtrans" and "help strongcomp" in MATLAB, for details on
how to use the MATLAB-callable functions.  Additional details on the use of BTF
are given in the KLU User Guide, normally in ../KLU/Doc/KLU_UserGuide.pdf
relative to this directory.
