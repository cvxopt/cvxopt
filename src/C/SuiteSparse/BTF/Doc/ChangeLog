Dec 7, 2011: version 1.1.3

    * fixed the Makefile to better align with CFLAGS and other standards

Jan 25, 2011: version 1.1.2

    * minor fix to "make install"

    * tabs expanded to 8 spaces; version number updated to stay in sync with KLU

Nov 1, 2007: version 1.0.1

    * trivial change to BTF/MATLAB/btf.c mexFunction: unused variable removed.

May 31, 2007:  version 1.0 released

    * the C application program interface has been modified (see below)

    * maxtrans function renamed to btf_maxtrans

    * strongcomp function renamed to btf_strongcomp

    * full statement coverage tests (KLU/Tcov)

    * maxwork parameter added to btf_maxtrans and btf_order

    * btf_maxtrans modified; now returns Q[i] = -1 if row i is unmatched;
        code to complete the permutation moved to btf_order.  This also
        changes the maxtrans mexFunction.

    * btf_install added for easy MATLAB installation

    * illustrative recursive version of maxtrans removed (see the recursive
        version of cs_maxtrans in CSparse instead)

    * MAXTRANS_* macros renamed BTF_*
