This directory contains CVXOPT specific modifications to the libraries 
in SuiteSparse necessary to build them with CVXOPT using distutils.

The additions are very minor; the directory contains a number of
files for different numerical types (int, long, single and double
precision floating point etc.) that would normally be automatically
generated by the C preprocessor.
